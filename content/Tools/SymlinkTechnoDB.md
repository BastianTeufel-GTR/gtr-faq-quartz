# Symlink TechnoDB

The TechnoDB_Symlinker.exe needs **Admin** rights!

The program enables to work with several technology databases by creating symbolic links
For example:

- Techno_1.ini 	=> technodb.ini
- Techno_2.ini 	=> technodb.ini

When you run the application, Windows Explorer opens directly. Here please select your Techo_DB.ini to be linked.

!!!hint "Hint"
    Only a system link is created. However, it is not unreasonable to make a backup of the TechnoDB.ini beforehand.
