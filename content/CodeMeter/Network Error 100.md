### Q: Error: A network error occured, Error 100

### A: Dongle not in PC or a Network problem

![[A_network_error_occured_ Error_100.png]]

1. Ensure that the Dongle is plugged in and the CodeMeter runtime is installed.<br>
2. Check your Network connection<br>
3. Insert ProfDia Dongle directly into PC<br>
4. Check if it's working now.

The error message can also come up, when the requested license is not coded on the found / plugged in license key.
